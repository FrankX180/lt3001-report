## 6. Business Model: Licensing-Focused

Lumosa's business model is the typical "Biotech licensing model":

```
Early R&D → Clinical trials → License to large pharmaceutical company → Receive upfront payment + milestones + royalties
```

### 6.1 Why Choose Licensing Rather Than Self-Commercialization?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Capital requirements | Phase 3 clinical + commercialization requires billions of dollars, beyond small company capacity |
| Sales network | Large pharma has established global sales teams |
| Risk diversification | Post-licensing, large pharma assumes subsequent risks |
| Time efficiency | Large pharma resources can accelerate development |

### 6.2 Revenue Structure in Licensing Model

| Item | Description | Estimated Amount |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Upfront** | One-time payment at signing | $50-100 million |
| **Milestones** | Payments upon achieving specific goals | $500 million - $1.5 billion |
| **Royalties** | Post-launch revenue share | 10-15% |

Lumosa's goal is to find a global pharmaceutical partner (such as Merck, Roche, J&J) as the licensing partner for LT3001.

| Centurion Group | Affiliated company | Investment holding under Rong-Jin Lin |
| National Development Fund | Government fund | Policy support |

### 7.2 Director Ownership Percentage

Directors collectively hold approximately 30-40%, indicating strong management control.

1. **Validates commercial value**: Shanghai Pharma is a top-tier Chinese pharmaceutical company; their willingness to pay demonstrates recognition of LT3001
2. **Accelerates China development**: China Phase 3 (LT3001-301) executed by Shanghai Pharma
3. **Data accumulation**: China Phase 3 data can support global applications
