# Chapter 7: Phase 3 Clinical Trials and FDA Progress

---

> **Chapter Summary**: Understanding LT3001 Phase 3 clinical trial design, timeline planning, and key milestones in the FDA approval process.

---

## 1. Phase 3 Trial Planning

### 1.1 Dual-Track Strategy

Lumosa has adopted a "China first, global follow" dual-track strategy:

| Trial | Region | Size | Start | Completion Est. |
|-------|--------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **LT3001-301** | China | ~800 | **2026 Q4** | 2028-2029 |
| **LT3001-302** | Global (US/EU/Taiwan) | ~400 | 2027 | 2029-2030 |

> **Important Update** (January 2026 Investor Meeting): FDA agreed to accept China data as the foundation, with the U.S. only requiring one multinational multi-center trial (approximately 400 patients) including U.S. sites for NDA submission. This significantly simplifies the global development strategy.

### 1.2 Why Choose Dual-Track Strategy?

**Advantage One: Risk Diversification**

If one trial encounters problems, the other can continue.

**Advantage Two: Accelerated Enrollment**

Simultaneous enrollment in China and globally speeds up total enrollment.

**Advantage Three: Regulatory Strategy**

- China Phase 3 success → China approval first
- China data can support global applications (ICH mutual recognition)

## 2. LT3001-301 (China Phase 3)

### 2.1 Trial Design: Phase 2/3 Seamless Design

FDA agreed to adopt a "**Seamless Design**" (Phase 2/3 Seamless Design)—an innovative trial design that allows expansion to Phase 3 scale without interrupting enrollment, after interim analysis confirms the optimal dose.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Trial phase | Phase 2/3 (Seamless) |
| Execution partner | Shanghai Pharmaceuticals |
| Number of sites | 40-50 (vs 28 in Phase 2) |
| Expected enrollment | ~800 |
| Enrollment criteria | NIHSS ≥7, onset 4.5-24 hours |
| Primary endpoint | mRS 0-2 @ 90 days |
| Control | Placebo |

**Seamless Design Two-Stage Approach**:

| Stage | Size | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Part A** | ~300 | High/low dose vs placebo, interim analysis confirms optimal dose |
| **Part B** | ~500 | Selected dose vs placebo, demonstrate statistical significance |

**Sample Size Flexibility**: If interim analysis shows treatment difference of **10-12%**, subsequent Part B sample size may decrease from 500, reducing total from 800 to **600-700 patients**.

### 2.2 Key Modifications (vs Phase 2)

| Item | Phase 2 (LT3001-202) | Phase 3 (LT3001-301) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| NIHSS lower limit | ≥4 | **≥7** |
| Mild case proportion | 25% | **Excluded** |
| Target population | Overall | **Disabling patients** |

### 2.3 Timeline Estimates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2026 Q1 | Shanghai Pharma submits to China CDE |
| **2026 Q4** | **Phase 3 enrollment begins** |
| **2027 Q3-Q4** | **Part A interim analysis** (confirms dose) |
| 2028 Q3-Q4 | Enrollment completion |
| 2029 Q1-Q2 | Data lock and analysis |
| 2029 Q2-Q3 | Data release |

**Enrollment Speed Estimate** (Investor Meeting Information): Shanghai Pharma estimates enrollment period of approximately **1 to 1.5 years** to complete, with sites expanding from 28 in Phase 2 to 40-50.

## 3. LT3001-302 (Global Phase 3)

### 3.1 Trial Design

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Trial phase | Phase 3 (Pivotal) |
| Regions | U.S., Europe, Taiwan |
| Expected enrollment | ~400 |
| Enrollment criteria | NIHSS ≥7, onset 4.5-24 hours |
| Primary endpoint | mRS 0-2 @ 90 days |

> **Strategic Adjustment**: FDA agreed to accept China data as foundation, reducing global trial size from originally estimated 600 to approximately 400, significantly reducing execution difficulty and cost.

### 3.2 FDA Type C Meeting Confirmations

In November 2025, FDA confirmed the following in the Type C meeting:

| Confirmed Item | FDA Position |
|----------------|--------------|
| Phase 2 data | Sufficient to support Phase 3 development |
| Subgroup design | Agrees to focus on "moderate-severe + disabling" |
| Primary endpoint | mRS 0-2 or mRS 0-1 both acceptable |
| **Trial design** | **Agrees to Phase 2/3 Seamless Design** |
| U.S. patient proportion | **No mandatory requirement** |
| Imaging selection | **Not required** |
| **China data reciprocity** | **Acceptable as NDA supporting data** |

**Key Significance**:

- FDA agreed to **Seamless Design**, can seamlessly expand to Phase 3 after interim analysis
- FDA has **no mandatory requirement** for U.S. patient proportion, significantly reducing execution difficulty and cost
- **China data can support U.S. NDA**, global trial size reduced to ~400 patients
- No imaging selection required, enrollment faster than JX10

### 3.3 Timeline Estimates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2027 Q1-Q2 | Enrollment begins |
| 2028 Q4-2029 Q1 | Interim analysis (if applicable) |
| 2029 Q3-Q4 | Enrollment completion |
| 2030 Q1-Q2 | Data release |

## 5. China Approval Pathway

### 5.1 NMPA Approval Process

China's regulatory agency (NMPA) has significantly accelerated new drug approvals in recent years:

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Priority Review** | For clinically urgent drugs, shortened review period |
| **Conditional Approval** | Can approve based on Phase 3 interim data |
| **ICH Reciprocity** | Accepts foreign clinical data |

### 5.2 Timeline Estimates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2029 Q2-Q3 | LT3001-301 data release |
| 2029 Q4-2030 Q1 | NDA submission |
| 2030 Q2-Q3 | **China approval** (estimated) |

**China may achieve approval earlier than U.S.**, as China Phase 3 starts first and NMPA review is faster.

| Q3-Q4 | Imaging trial results | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Q4** | **China Phase 3 (301) enrollment begins** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Q4 | Licensing agreement signing (estimated) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

> **ISC Presentation Note**: LT3001 Phase 2 results were selected for **2026 ISC Closing Session Oral Presentation**, presented by U.S. physician Dr. Devlin. This is a high honor—Late Breaking Oral Presentations are typically reserved for completed Phase 3 results or major breakthroughs. LT3001's selection with only Phase 2 data indicates the academic community views it as a potential major medical breakthrough.

| Mechanistic innovation | Different pathway from tPA | ⬆️ Increases |
| Time window challenge | 4.5-24hr thrombolysis difficulty | ⬇️ Decreases |

### 7.3 Comprehensive Assessment

| Scenario | Phase 3 Success Probability | Notes |
|----------|----------------------------|-------|
| Based on history | 15-20% | Historical stroke drug failure rate |
| **Considering specific factors** | **60-70%** | Safety data and design corrections are positives |

**Conclusion**: LT3001's Phase 3 success probability is higher than typical stroke drugs.

## 9. Chapter Summary

| Key Point | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Dual-track strategy | China first (2026 Q4), global follow (2027) |
| Trial design | Phase 2/3 Seamless Design, interim analysis confirms dose |
| Phase 3 size | China ~800 patients, Global ~400 patients |
| FDA stance | Positive, agrees to design, no mandatory ratio, China data reciprocity |
| Near-term catalysts | ISC presentation (2/6), China Phase 3 start (Q4) |
| Expected approval | China 2030 H1, U.S. 2030 Q3-2031 Q1 |
| **Success probability** | **60-70%** (mechanistic simplicity + safety data) |

**Core Conclusion**:

> LT3001's Phase 3 planning is reasonable, with extremely positive FDA stance (agrees to Seamless Design, China data reciprocity, no mandatory U.S. patient proportion). **February 2026 ISC presentation** and **Q4 China Phase 3 start** are the most important near-term catalysts. Based on mechanistic simplicity and 0% bleeding safety data, Phase 3 success probability is estimated at 60-70%, significantly higher than the historical stroke drug average (15-20%).
