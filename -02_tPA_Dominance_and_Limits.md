# Chapter 2: tPA's 30-Year Dominance and Limitations

---

> **Chapter Summary**: Understanding why tPA has dominated for 30 years, and the fundamental limitations it cannot overcome.

---

## 1. The Birth of tPA

In 1996, the U.S. FDA approved Alteplase (brand name: Activase) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

This was based on results from the NINDS trial—which demonstrated that administering tPA within 3 hours of stroke onset significantly increased the probability of favorable patient outcomes.

**To understand tPA, you first need to understand how blood clots form.**

### How Blood Clots Form: A "Fibrin Net"

When a blood vessel is injured, the body activates coagulation mechanisms to stop bleeding:

```
Vessel injury
    ↓
Platelets aggregate at the wound (like sandbags at a breach)
    ↓
Coagulation factors trigger a cascade reaction
    ↓
Fibrinogen → Fibrin
    ↓
Fibrin forms a "mesh structure"
    ↓
This mesh traps platelets and red blood cells → Forms a clot
```

**Analogy**:

Think of a blood clot like a plate of spaghetti—

- **Noodles** = Fibrin, woven into a net
- **Meatballs** = Platelets and red blood cells, tangled in the noodles
- **The whole plate** = Blood clot, blocking the vessel

Under normal circumstances, this is a life-saving hemostatic mechanism. But when a clot forms in a cerebral vessel, it becomes a life-threatening obstruction.

### The Principle of Thrombolysis: Cutting That Net

The body naturally has a "clot-dissolving" system, with these core components:

| Component | Function | Analogy |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Plasminogen** | The "thrombolytic raw material" in blood, **inactive by itself** | Unsharpened scissors |
| **Plasmin** | The activated "thrombolytic enzyme," **active** | Sharpened scissors |
| **Fibrin** | The "noodles" that make up the clot mesh | What gets cut |

The thrombolysis process is:

```
Plasminogen (inactive scissors)
         ↓ Needs an "activator" to sharpen
Plasmin (active scissors)
         ↓ Cuts
Fibrin mesh is cut apart → Clot dissolves → Blood flow restored
```

**Key question: Who "activates" these scissors?**

### tPA's Mechanism of Action

tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) is that "activator":

```
tPA injected into bloodstream
         ↓
Directly activates "Plasminogen" → "Plasmin" in blood
         ↓
Plasmin (sharpened scissors) cuts everywhere
         ↓
Fibrin mesh cut apart → Clot dissolves
```

This is an "exogenous" thrombolytic pathway—injecting large amounts of activator from outside to forcibly sharpen all the "scissors."

**The problem is**: tPA activation is "systemic." It doesn't just activate plasminogen near the clot; it activates plasminogen throughout the entire bloodstream.

The result: "Good clots" that are performing necessary hemostasis elsewhere also get dissolved, leading to → **2-6% intracranial hemorrhage risk**.

---

## 2. Why No New Drugs in 30 Years?

From 1996 to 2026—a full 30 years.

During this period:

- Pharmaceutical companies invested **billions of dollars** developing new thrombolytic agents
- **Dozens** of large clinical trials were conducted
- **All failed**

Why?

### 2.1 The "Dissolving Too Little" vs "Dissolving Too Much" Dilemma

Thrombolytic drugs face a fundamental contradiction:

| Problem | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Dissolving too little | Clot isn't dissolved → Brain cells continue dying from ischemia → Ineffective |
| Dissolving too much | "Hemostatic clots" that shouldn't be dissolved also break down → Brain hemorrhage → Fatal |

tPA's problem is: it's "systemic" thrombolysis.

Once injected, tPA acts throughout the bloodstream, dissolving not only the "bad clot" in the cerebral vessel but also "good clots" elsewhere in the body that are performing necessary hemostasis.

The result: **2-6%** intracranial hemorrhage risk.

### 2.2 All Successors Fell into the Same Trap

Over the past 30 years, many "improved tPAs" attempted to solve this problem:

| Drug | Improvement Approach | Result |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| TNKase (Tenecteplase) | Extended half-life, reduced dose | Similar bleeding risk |
| Desmoteplase | Increased fibrin selectivity | Phase 3 failed |
| Ancrod | Reduced fibrinogen | Phase 3 failed |
| Various neuroprotectants | Protected brain cells | All failed (over 100 attempts) |

**Root cause**: None escaped tPA's "exogenous systemic thrombolysis" framework.

As long as the approach is "injecting large amounts of thrombolytic enzyme from outside," the same bleeding risk persists.

---

## 3. tPA's Three Fundamental Limitations

### Limitation One: Treatment Window Too Short

tPA must be administered within **4.5 hours** of symptom onset.

Why?

Because beyond this time:

1. The clot becomes increasingly "old" and harder, more difficult to dissolve
2. The longer brain tissue is ischemic, the more fragile vessel walls become, increasing rupture risk when blood flow is restored
3. The salvageable penumbra becomes smaller, worsening the risk-benefit ratio

**Real-world situation**:

| Time from Onset to Treatment | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| Patient recognizes stroke | 30-60 minutes (many don't realize they're having a stroke) |
| Transport to hospital | 30-90 minutes (depends on distance and traffic) |
| Complete imaging | 30-60 minutes (must rule out hemorrhagic stroke) |
| Treatment decision and administration | 15-30 minutes |
| **Total** | **2-4 hours** |

Under ideal circumstances, quality healthcare systems in major cities can complete this within 4.5 hours.

But in remote areas, developing countries, or for strokes occurring at night, the vast majority of patients will miss this treatment window.

### Limitation Two: Bleeding Risk Too High

Patients receiving tPA have a **2-6%** chance of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH).

This number may not sound high, but its practical meaning is:

> **For every 20-50 tPA treatments, 1 patient may experience intracranial hemorrhage.**

For emergency physicians, this is an enormous psychological burden:

| Scenario | Outcome | Physician's Legal/Ethical Responsibility |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| No treatment → Patient disabled | "This was caused by the disease itself" | Lower |
| Treatment → Patient dies from hemorrhage | "The doctor's drug killed them" | Higher |

**Result**: Many eligible patients don't receive treatment because physicians prefer "non-intervention."

According to statistics, even among patients meeting tPA eligibility criteria, actual utilization is only **30-50%**.

### Limitation Three: Global Utilization Below 5%

Combining the above two limitations:

| Limiting Factor | Excluded Patient Proportion |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Beyond 4.5-hour window | ~70-80% |
| Eligible but physician won't prescribe | ~50-70% |
| **Final utilization rate** | **<5%** |

**For 30 years, less than 5% of stroke patients worldwide have been able to receive tPA treatment.**

This isn't because the drug is too expensive or supply is insufficient—it's because the drug's inherent limitations prevent widespread use.

---

## 4. The Physician's Dilemma

Let's think from an emergency physician's perspective:

**Scenario**: A 65-year-old male, 3 hours post-stroke onset, NIHSS 12 (moderate hemiparesis), meets tPA eligibility criteria.

**Option A: Don't administer tPA**

- Patient may become disabled (mRS 3-4)
- But this is "caused by the disease itself"
- Physician has no legal liability

**Option B: Administer tPA**

- If successful, patient may fully recover (mRS 0-1)
- But 5-6% chance of intracranial hemorrhage
- If hemorrhage occurs, family may say "your drug killed them"
- Lawsuits, public opinion, moral guilt...

**Most physicians will choose A.**

Not because they don't want to save lives, but because the 5-6% hemorrhage risk is simply too frightening.

It's like asking you to defuse a bomb with a 95% success rate—

Sounds like a high success rate?

Great! Then the bomb is yours to defuse, okay?

## 5. Why We Need a New Drug

The ideal stroke thrombolytic should have:

| Characteristic | Current tPA | Ideal Drug |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Treatment window | 4.5 hours | **≥24 hours** |
| ICH risk | 2-6% | **<1%** |
| Thrombolytic efficiency | Moderate | Higher |
| Neuroprotection | None | Yes |
| Administration | IV infusion | Simple and easy |

Achieving these would fundamentally transform the stroke treatment landscape:

1. **Cover more patients**: From 5% → 30-50%
2. **Physicians more willing to prescribe**: Lower bleeding risk makes decisions easier
3. **Better outcomes**: More patients can recover independent function

This is what LT3001 aims to achieve.

---

## 6. The TNKase Story: Why "Improvement" Isn't Enough

In March 2025, Roche/Genentech's TNKase (Tenecteplase) received FDA approval for stroke.

This is the first "new" thrombolytic drug in 30 years—but is it truly a breakthrough?

### TNKase vs tPA Comparison

| Item | tPA | TNKase |
|------|-----|--------|
| Administration | 1-hour IV infusion | Single IV injection (more convenient) |
| Treatment window | 4.5 hours | 4.5 hours (**same**) |
| ICH risk | 2-6% | 2-3% (**slightly lower but similar**) |
| Price | ~$8,000 | ~$6,000 |

**Conclusion**: TNKase is an "improved version" of tPA, but not a "revolutionary breakthrough."

It solved the administration inconvenience (from 1 hour to seconds), but didn't solve the fundamental problems of treatment window and bleeding risk.

If LT3001 can achieve:

- Treatment window **24 hours** (vs TNKase 4.5 hours)
- Bleeding risk **0%** (vs TNKase 2-3%)

Then it will be a completely different class of drug.

## 7. Chapter Summary

| Key Point | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| tPA's status | Only effective thrombolytic drug for 30 years |
| Core limitations | Treatment window too short (4.5hr), bleeding risk too high (2-6%) |
| Global utilization | <5% (vast majority of patients cannot benefit) |
| Past 30 years | Dozens of improved drugs all failed |
| Root cause | None escaped the "exogenous systemic thrombolysis" framework |
| Breakthrough direction | Requires entirely new mechanism, not incremental improvement |

**LT3001's opportunity lies in**: It's not an "improved tPA"—it's a fundamentally different thrombolytic pathway.

Next chapter, we will introduce Lumosa Therapeutics' background and LT3001's development history.
