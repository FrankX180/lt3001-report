## 1. Investment Thesis Summary

### 1.1 Core Proposition

> **LT3001 has the potential to become the most significant breakthrough in stroke treatment in 30 years.**

### 1.2 Supporting Arguments

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **Mechanistic innovation** | Plasminogen redistribution + uPA pathway, not an "improved tPA" |
| **Outstanding safety** | 0% sICH (0/297), a mechanistic outcome |
| **Extended window** | 4.5-24 hours, covers more patients |
| **FDA endorsement** | Positive Type C meeting response, agrees to Phase 3 design |
| **Massive market** | Peak Sales $3.8-11.5 billion/year (base case $7.68B) |
| **Limited competition** | JX10 is sole serious competitor, with data questions |

## 2. Scenario Analysis

### 2.1 Optimistic Scenario (Probability 20-25%)

| Condition | Assumption |
|-----------|------------|
| Phase 3 result | mRS 0-2 Δ ≥ 12%, highly significant |
| Safety | sICH < 1% (maintains outstanding profile) |
| Licensing | Upfront > $100M, total deal value > $2.0B |
| Approval | FDA approval in 2030 |
| Market | Peak Sales $11.07 billion/year (optimistic) |

**Stock Price Impact**:

- Short-term (post-licensing): +50-100%
- Long-term (post-approval): Could reach NT$500-800

### 2.2 Base Case Scenario (Probability 35-40%)

| Condition | Assumption |
|-----------|------------|
| Phase 3 result | mRS 0-2 Δ = 8-10%, statistically significant |
| Safety | sICH 1-2% (still better than tPA) |
| Licensing | Upfront $70M, total deal value $1.5B |
| Approval | FDA approval in 2031 |
| Market | Peak Sales $7.68 billion/year (base case) |

**Stock Price Impact**:

- Short-term (post-licensing): +20-40%
- Long-term (post-approval): Could reach NT$350-500

### 2.3 Bearish Scenario (Probability 20-30%)

| Condition | Assumption |
|-----------|------------|
| Phase 3 result | Fails to achieve statistical significance OR sICH > 3% |
| Licensing | Partner exercises termination right OR terms significantly downgraded |
| Next steps | Additional trials required OR development abandoned |

**Stock Price Impact**:

- Short-term: -50-70%
- Long-term: Depends on subsequent plans

## 3. Valuation Analysis

### 3.1 Phased Cash Flow Estimates

| Year | Event | Cash Flow (USD) |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 2026 | Upfront | $70 million |
| 2027 | Option Fee | $40 million |
| 2028 | Clinical milestone | $100 million |
| 2029 | Clinical milestone | $150 million |
| 2030 | Regulatory milestone | $100 million |
| 2031 | Launch milestone | $150 million |
| 2032 | Royalties begin | $100 million |
| 2033 | Royalties | $200 million |
| 2034 | Royalties | $400 million |
| 2035+ | Peak royalties | $600 million/year |

### 3.2 Cumulative EPS Valuation Method

**Valuation Logic**: Calculate **cumulative total royalties** Lumosa can receive from launch (2031) to patent expiration (2045), convert to cumulative EPS, which equals reasonable target price.

> **Conservative Assumption**: Post-patent expiration sales revenue will continue but is not included in this calculation, presenting conservative scenario.

**Base Data** (from Chapter 8):

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Peak royalties | **$1.06 billion/year** (base case 20% penetration) |
| Shares outstanding | **169 million** |
| FX assumption | 1 USD = 32 TWD |
| Patent protection | ~14 years post-launch (through 2045) |

**Sales Ramp and Annual Royalty Estimates**:

| Year | Sales Ramp | Annual Royalty (USD B) | NTD (B) | Annual EPS (NTD) |
|------|------------|----------------------|---------|------------------|
| 2031 | 20% | 0.21 | 6.7 | 40 |
| 2032 | 40% | 0.42 | 13.4 | 79 |
| 2033 | 60% | 0.64 | 20.5 | 121 |
| 2034 | 80% | 0.85 | 27.2 | 161 |
| 2035-2045 | 100% | 10.6 × 11 = 116.6 | 373.1 | **201 × 11 = 2,211** |
| **Total** (2031-2045) | — | **$13.78B** | **441.0B** | **~NT$2,612** |

**Target Price by Scenario**:

| Scenario | Penetration | Cumulative Royalties | Cumulative EPS | Success Probability |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | 10% | $6.89B | **~NT$1,306** | 20-25% |
| **Base Case** | **20%** | **$13.78B** | **~NT$2,612** | **35-40%** |
| Optimistic | 30% | $20.67B | **~NT$3,918** | 20-25% |
| Bearish (failure) | — | 0 | **~NT$50-100** (residual value) | 20-30% |

**Risk-Adjusted Weighted Valuation**:

```
Weighted price = (1,306 × 22.5%) + (2,612 × 37.5%) + (3,918 × 22.5%) + (75 × 17.5%)
              = 294 + 980 + 881 + 13
              ≈ NT$2,168
```

> **Conclusion**: Using cumulative EPS valuation, base case (20% penetration) corresponds to target price approximately **NT$2,612**, risk-adjusted approximately **NT$2,168**.

### 3.3 Relative Valuation Reference

**2024-2025 Major Neurology/Chronic Disease Licensing Cases**:

| Licensing Case | Stage | Indication | Upfront | Total Deal Value | Est. Peak Sales |
|----------------|-------|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Novartis-PTC | Phase 2/3 | Huntington's | **$1.0B** | **$2.9B** | $10-20B |
| Pfizer-3SBio | Phase 3 | Cancer bispecific | **$1.25B** | **$6.05B** | $15-30B |
| Roche-Zealand | Phase 2 | Obesity | **$1.65B** | Not disclosed | $30B+ |
| GSK-Hengrui | Phase 2/3 | COPD | **$500M** | **$12.0B+** | Not disclosed |
| **LT3001 (Est.)** | Phase 3 | **Stroke** | **$70-100M** | **$1.5-2.1B** | **$7.68B** |

> **Trend Observation**: 2024 Phase II/III asset Upfronts jumped significantly vs 2023, reflecting "flight to quality"—large pharma willing to pay more for lower-risk assets.

**License Value / Peak Sales Ratio Analysis**:

| Drug | Peak Sales | Total Deal Value | **License/Peak Ratio** | Notes |
|------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| PTC518 | $10-20B | $2.9B | **150-300%** | Rare disease premium |
| SSGJ-707 | $15-30B | $6.05B | **200-400%** | Hot cancer space |
| Petrelintide | $30B+ | $1.65B+ | **~55%** | Competitive obesity market |
| **LT3001** | **$7.68B** | **$1.5-2.1B** | **~20-27%** | **Relatively conservative** |

> **Conclusion**: LT3001's license/Peak Sales ratio (20-27%) is notably lower than Huntington's (150-300%) and cancer bispecific (200-400%), reflecting stroke drugs' high historical failure rate creating a "market shadow." But conversely, **if Phase 3 succeeds, licensing terms have significant upward revision potential**.

## 6. Common Market Misconceptions

### 6.1 Misconception One: "Phase 2 Data Is Poor"

**Correct Understanding**:

- Overall +7.5% was diluted by mild patients
- Subgroup (disabling) improvement +13-21%
- FDA understood, agreed to Phase 3 design

### 6.2 Misconception Two: "0% Bleeding Is Too Perfect"

**Correct Understanding**:

- This is a mechanistic outcome, not statistical fluctuation
- LT3001 acts locally, doesn't cause systemic thrombolysis
- Animal studies also support low bleeding risk

### 6.3 Misconception Three: "Drug Price Is Only Worth $5,000"

**Correct Understanding**:

- Traditional estimation significantly undervalues
- Insurance companies willing to pay $25,000-30,000
- Because it saves $300,000+ in long-term care costs

### 6.4 Misconception Four: "JX10 Is Better Than LT3001"

**Correct Understanding**:

- Two trials had different enrollment severity, cannot directly compare
- JX10 has no dose-response, mechanism questionable
- LT3001 has more clinical data support

## 7. Chapter Summary

| Key Point | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Core thesis | LT3001 may be the most important stroke drug breakthrough in 30 years |
| Risk-adjusted valuation | ~NT$330/share (base case) |
| Largest near-term catalyst | 2026 Q4 licensing agreement |
| Defining moment | 2029 Phase 3 data release |
| Phase 3 success probability | 35-45% |
| Suitable for | Long-term value investors willing to tolerate high volatility |

**Final Conclusion**:

> LT3001 is a "high risk, high reward" investment opportunity. Its mechanistic innovation and safety data provide success probability exceeding historical averages, but Phase 3 failure risk remains non-negligible. For investors willing to tolerate volatility with a 3-5 year investment horizon, this is a target worthy of serious research.

## 8. Disclaimer

All analysis in this book is based on publicly available information and does not constitute investment advice.

New drug development involves high uncertainty, with historical Phase 3 success rates of approximately 25-30%. Even the most optimistic scenarios carry possibility of complete failure.

Investors should:

1. Conduct independent research
2. Assess personal risk tolerance
3. Never invest money you cannot afford to lose
4. Diversify investments, avoid concentration in single positions

**Investing involves risk; enter market with caution.**
