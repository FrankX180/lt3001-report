## B.3 JX10 Deep Comparison

### B.3.1 Mechanism Differences

| Dimension | LT3001 | JX10 |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Core action | Concentrates Plasminogen at clot | Changes Plasminogen conformation |
| Analogy | Brings firefighters to the fire | Opens the door, waits for firefighters to come |
| Reliability | ✅ High (independent of patient status) | ⚠️ Depends on patient's own tPA/uPA |

### B.3.2 Data Comparability Issues

| Metric | JX10 Phase 2a | LT3001-202 | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Placebo mRS 0-2 | **36.8%** | **78.4%** | **41.6% gap** |
| NIHSS lower limit | ≥6 | ≥4 | JX10 excludes mild |
| Lacunar limit | ≤50% | None | JX10 limits dilution |
| **Conclusion** | — | — | **Cannot directly compare** |

### B.3.3 JX10 Key Issues (See Chapter 6 for Details)

| Issue | Explanation | Risk Level |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **No dose-response** | 1 mg/kg works best, 6 mg/kg no better — violates pharmacological logic | ⚠️ **High** |
| **24hr improvement worse** | Drug group 27.5% vs Placebo 35.1% (-7.6%) — thrombolytic effect questionable | ⚠️ **High** |
| **Thrombolysis vs Anti-inflammatory** | If primarily anti-inflammatory, should be "adjunctive" not "competitor" | ⚠️ Medium |
| Sample too small | Only 52 cases, high statistical fluctuation | ⚠️ Medium |
| LVO unvalidated | Excluded complete ICA occlusion, large vessel efficacy unknown | ⚠️ Medium |

> **Core Question**: JX10's 24-hour improvement was actually lower than placebo, suggesting its efficacy may primarily come from "anti-inflammatory reducing subsequent deterioration" rather than "thrombolysis restoring blood flow." If this hypothesis holds, JX10 is more suitable as an **adjunctive drug** to LT3001, not a direct competitor.

## B.8 Conclusion

| Conclusion | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Primary competitor | JX10 is the only potential competitor, but threat level uncertain |
| **JX10 key issue** | **No dose-response + worse 24hr improvement = thrombolytic effect questionable** |
| JX10 possible positioning | If primarily anti-inflammatory, more suitable as LT3001 "adjunctive drug" |
| LT3001 advantages | Safety sample size (5.7x), clear dose-response, LVO data, China strategy |
| JX10 advantages | Dosing convenience (single injection), slightly earlier Phase 3 start |
| Approval timeline | Similar, LT3001 may be slightly earlier (no imaging selection required) |
| Market capacity | If both launch, market is sufficient — but JX10 must first prove thrombolytic effect |
