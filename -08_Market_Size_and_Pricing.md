## 1. Global Stroke Market Overview

### 1.1 Epidemiological Data

| Metric | Global | U.S. | EU | China |
|--------|--------|------|-----|-------|
| Annual incidence | **11.9 million** | 800,000 | 1.1 million | 3 million |
| Ischemic proportion | **65.3%** | 87% | 85% | 70% |
| **Ischemic incidence** | **7.8 million** | **690,000** | **940,000** | **2.1 million** |

> **Source**: GBD 2021, Lancet Neurology 2024, China Stroke Prevention and Treatment Report 2024

### 1.2 LT3001 Target Patient Population

LT3001 targets "4.5-24 hour window, EVT-ineligible" ischemic stroke patients.

| Selection Criteria | Proportion | Global Patients |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Ischemic stroke | 65.3% | 7.8 million |
| Present at hospital 4.5-24hr | ~70% | **5.5 million** |
| EVT-ineligible | ~90% | 4.9 million |
| NIHSS ≥7 + no contraindications | ~57% | **~2.8 million** |
| **Addressable patients** | — | **~2.8 million/year** |

> **Selection Logic**: Approximately 70% of stroke patients cannot reach hospital within 4.5 hours (miss tPA window), 90% of those are not suitable for mechanical thrombectomy (EVT), then selecting moderate-severe (NIHSS ≥7) with no absolute contraindications.
> => Addressable patients approximately 36% = 2.8 million / 7.8 million

### 1.3 Regional Distribution

| Region | Ischemic Stroke/Year | Addressable Patients/Year | Share |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| China | 2.1 million | **760,000** | **27%** |
| U.S. | 690,000 | 250,000 | 9% |
| EU | 940,000 | 350,000 | 13% |
| Japan | 190,000 | 70,000 | 2% |
| Other | 3.88 million | 1.37 million | 49% |
| **Global** | **7.8 million** | **~2.8 million** | **100%** |

## 2. Drug Pricing Logic

### 2.1 Traditional vs Value-Based Estimation

| Method | Estimated Price | Issue |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Traditional (benchmarking tPA) | $3,000-5,000 | **Significant underestimation** |
| **Value-based** | **$10,000-30,000** | Reasonable |

Traditional estimation only looks at "what existing drugs sell for," ignoring LT3001's **unique value**.

### 2.2 Insurance Company Cost-Benefit Calculation

The core logic of insurance pricing is: **How much money can the drug save?**

**True Post-Stroke Costs (U.S.)**:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| ER + ICU hospitalization 7-14 days | $50,000 |
| Rehabilitation hospital 1-2 months | $80,000 |
| If severe disability, nursing home/year | $80,000 |
| **Lifetime care cost (severe disability)** | **$300,000-500,000** |

**LT3001 Value Calculation**:

```
Assume LT3001 prevents disability in 20% of patients
Avoided cost per patient: $300,000 × 20% = $60,000

Insurance company maximum willingness to pay: 40-50% of $60,000 = $24,000-30,000
```

**Conclusion**: From a cost-benefit perspective, U.S. insurance companies are willing to pay **$25,000-30,000/patient**.

### 2.3 Regional Pricing Estimates

| Region | LTC Cost/Person | Avoidable Cost (20%) | Insurance Max WTP | **Est. Drug Price** |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| U.S. | $300,000 | $60,000 | $25,000-30,000 | **$27,500** |
| EU | $150,000 | $30,000 | $15,000-20,000 | **$18,000** |
| Japan | $100,000 | $20,000 | $12,000-18,000 | **$15,000** |
| China | $30,000 | $6,000 | $8,000-12,000 | **$10,000** |

## 3. Why Insurance Companies Are Willing to Pay

### 3.1 Core Logic: Prevention Over Treatment

The essence of insurance is risk pooling for broader coverage. When a treatment can **significantly reduce subsequent medical and care burden**, insurance companies have sufficient economic incentive to cover it—this isn't "cost-saving" but **allocating resources where they matter most**.

> A single $25,000 treatment that transforms someone from lifetime bedridden to functional independence—this expenditure provides a family the chance to avoid collapse, a person the opportunity to stand again.

### 3.2 Economic Benefit Analysis

**Scenario Calculation: 100 U.S. Patients Cost Comparison**

**Assumptions**:

| Assumption | Value | Basis |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Drug cost per patient | **$25,000** | See Section 2.3 value-based pricing |
| Lifetime LTC cost per patient | **$300,000** | See Section 2.2 U.S. data |
| Disability rate without treatment | **35%** | Moderate-severe stroke epidemiology (Note 1) |
| Disability rate with treatment | **15%** | 20 percentage point reduction (Note 2) |

> **Note 1**: Moderate-severe ischemic stroke patients (NIHSS ≥7) without effective reperfusion treatment have approximately 35-50% developing severe disability requiring long-term care (mRS 4-6). LT3001-202 placebo group disability rate was lower (21.6%) because enrollment criteria included 25% mild patients and trial supportive care was superior. Phase 3 will exclude mild cases (NIHSS ≥7), and placebo disability rate will be closer to real-world 35-40%.
>
> **Note 2**: Phase 2 subgroup analysis shows that in "disabling patients" (with clear motor deficit), LT3001 increased mRS 0-2 rate by **13-21 percentage points** (see Chapter 5). Using conservative midpoint of 20 percentage points for estimation.

**Cost Calculation**:

| Scenario | Disabled | Drug Cost | LTC Cost | **Total Cost** |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Without LT3001 | 35 | $0 | 35 × $300K = **$10.5M** | **$10.5M** |
| With LT3001 | 15 | 100 × $25K = **$2.5M** | 15 × $300K = **$4.5M** | **$7.0M** |

**Conclusion**: For every 100 patients treated, insurance companies can save **$3.5 million** in claims burden while allowing **20 people to avoid lifetime disability**.

This isn't just numbers—**every reduced disability case is one person who can embrace family again, return to work, regain dignity.**

### 3.3 Additional Value from Safety

**Reduced Medical Risk**

tPA's 5-6% intracranial hemorrhage rate puts physicians in a dilemma during emergencies: the lifesaving drug itself may cause harm. LT3001's **0% intracranial hemorrhage rate** simplifies medical decisions—physicians can prescribe with greater confidence, and families can more easily accept treatment recommendations.

**Supporting Patient Return to Society**

Functionally independent patients can:

- Return to work, maintaining family finances
- Live independently, reducing family caregiver burden
- Continue participating in social activities, preserving life meaning

### 3.4 Value Comparison with Other Drugs

| Drug | Indication | Price | Patient Value |
|------|------------|-------|---------------|
| Keytruda | Cancer | $150,000/year | Extended life |
| Zolgensma | Infant SMA | $2,100,000/dose | Cure rare disease |
| Luxturna | Hereditary blindness | $850,000/dose | Restored vision |
| **LT3001** | **Stroke** | **$25,000/dose** | **Restored mobility** |

Among these life-changing treatments, LT3001's pricing is relatively accessible, yet can deliver equally profound impact—**transforming someone from potential lifetime bedridden to walking out the door on their own.**

## 4. Market Size Estimation

Since China drug pricing is heavily influenced by national health insurance negotiations, with nearly **9x gap** from US/EU, we calculate separately.

### 4.1 Global Market (Excluding China)

**Target patients**: Global 7.8 million − China 2.1 million = **5.7 million**, calculating addressable ~36% = **2.05 million/year**

**Regional Price Weighting**:

| Region | Share | Est. Price | Weighted Contribution | Pricing Basis |
|--------|-------|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| U.S. | 28% | $27,500 | $7,700 | LTC cost $300-500K |
| EU | 36% | $18,000 | $6,480 | Mature healthcare system |
| Japan | 10% | $15,000 | $1,500 | Aging population demand |
| Other | 26% | $10,000 | $2,600 | Emerging markets |
| **Total** | **100%** | — | **$18,280** | **Rounded to $18,000** |

**Market Size (100% Penetration)**: 2.05 million × $18,000 = **$36.9 billion**

### 4.2 China Market

China's existing tPA average price is approximately RMB 7,000. LT3001 priced at **2x premium** (RMB 14,000 ≈ **$1,950**).

| Item | Data |
|------|------|
| Target patients | **760,000/year** |
| Estimated price | **$1,950** (approx. RMB 14,000) |
| Market size (100% penetration) | **$1.48 billion** |

> **Why is China pricing so low?** China's national health insurance negotiations significantly compress drug prices. Referencing similar drugs, even innovative drugs in China typically have pricing at only 10-20% of US/EU levels.

### 4.3 Combined Peak Sales

| Scenario | Penetration | Global (Ex-China) | China | **Combined Peak Sales** |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|------------------------|
| Conservative | 10% | $3.69B | $0.15B | **$3.84B** |
| **Base Case** | **20%** | **$7.38B** | **$0.30B** | **$7.68B** |
| Optimistic | 30% | $11.07B | $0.44B | **$11.51B** |

> **Calculation Basis**:
>
> - Global (Ex-China): 2.05 million × penetration × $18,000
> - China: 760,000 × penetration × $1,950

### 4.4 Why Can Penetration Reach 20%?

**Compared to tPA U.S. penetration of approximately 15%** (reverse-calculated from Roche financials):

| Factor | tPA Limitation | LT3001 Advantage |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Time window | Only 4.5 hours | **24 hours** |
| Bleeding risk | 2-6% ICH | **0%** |
| Physician psychology | Hesitant due to liability concerns | High safety → More willing to prescribe |
| Insurance coverage | Average cost-benefit | Good cost-benefit → Willing to pay |

LT3001 simultaneously solves both "too short time window" and "bleeding risk" pain points. Achieving 1.3x tPA penetration (20%) is a reasonable expectation.

## 5. Lumosa Revenue Share Estimation

### 5.1 Revenue Structure Under Licensing Model

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Upfront | One-time payment at signing |
| Milestones | Payments upon achieving targets |
| **Royalties** | **Post-launch revenue share based on sales** |

### 5.2 Royalty Rate Assumptions

Since China and global markets have different licensing partners, royalty rates differ:

| Market | Licensing Partner | Est. Royalty Rate |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Global (Ex-China)** | International pharma (pending) | **14%** |
| **China** | Shanghai Pharmaceuticals | **9%** |

> **Why lower China royalty?** Shanghai Pharmaceuticals already paid upfront licensing fees (up to RMB 610 million) and bears China clinical trial costs, hence lower royalty rate.

### 5.3 Royalty Income Estimation

| Scenario | Global Peak Sales | Global Royalty (14%) | China Peak Sales | China Royalty (9%) | **Combined Royalty/Year** |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Conservative | $3.69B | $0.52B | $0.15B | $0.013B | **$0.53B** |
| **Base Case** | **$7.38B** | **$1.03B** | **$0.30B** | **$0.027B** | **$1.06B** |
| Optimistic | $11.07B | $1.55B | $0.44B | $0.040B | **$1.59B** |

### 5.4 Conversion to Annual EPS

Assuming Lumosa has approximately 169 million shares outstanding (capital of NT$1.69 billion):

| Scenario | Royalty/Year | NTD (Billion) | **Peak EPS** |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Conservative | $0.53B | 17.0 | **~NT$101** |
| **Base Case** | **$1.06B** | **33.9** | **~NT$201** |
| Optimistic | $1.59B | 50.9 | **~NT$301** |

> **Note**: This is annual EPS at Peak Sales stage, expected around 2034.

## 6. Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Partnership Value

### 6.1 License Terms

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Territory | China (including Hong Kong and Macau) |
| Total license value | Up to **RMB 610 million** |
| Royalty rate | **9%** (incorporating upfront license fees) |
| Partnership advantage | Shanghai Pharma has nationwide sales network |

### 6.2 China Market Positioning

China is the world's largest stroke market (27% of patients), but drug pricing constraints from national health insurance limit revenue contribution:

| Metric | China | Global (Ex-China) | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------|
| Target patients | 760,000 | 2.05 million | China is 27% |
| Drug price | $1,950 | $18,000 | China only 11% |
| Peak Sales (20%) | $0.30B | $7.38B | China only 4% |
| Royalty contribution | $0.027B | $1.03B | China only 2.5% |

> **Conclusion**: China market's value lies in "high patient volume, fast enrollment," accelerating clinical trial progress, rather than direct revenue contribution. Global licensing is the core engine of Lumosa's valuation.

## 8. Chapter Summary

| Key Point | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Global ischemic stroke | **7.8 million/year** (GBD 2021) |
| Target patients | Global (Ex-China) **2.05 million** + China **760,000** = **2.81 million/year** |
| Pricing logic | Value-based: Global **$18,000**, China **$1,950** |
| Combined Peak Sales | **$3.8-11.5 billion/year** (conservative-optimistic) |
| Lumosa royalty | **$0.53-1.59 billion/year** (conservative-optimistic) |
| Peak EPS | **NT$101-301** (conservative-optimistic) |

**Core Conclusion**:

> LT3001's market size is driven by two engines: **Global market** (high price $18,000, high royalty 14%) contributes 97% of profits; **China market** (low price $1,950, low royalty 9%) accelerates clinical progress. Using base case scenario, combined Peak Sales approximately **$7.68 billion/year**, Lumosa royalty approximately **$1.06 billion/year**, corresponding to Peak EPS approximately **NT$201**.
