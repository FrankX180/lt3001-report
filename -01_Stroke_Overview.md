## 1. The Second Leading Cause of Death Globally

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, second only to heart disease.

According to the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2021):

| Metric | Global Data | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Annual incidence | **12.2 million** | One stroke every 2.6 seconds; 17 per 10,000 people globally |
| Annual deaths | **6.6 million** | One death every 4.8 seconds |
| Disability rate among survivors | **50%** | Half of survivors have permanent disability |
| 5-year recurrence rate | **25-35%** | Having one stroke increases risk of another |

In China, the situation is even more severe:

| Metric | China Data |
|--------|------------|
| Annual incidence | **3.94 million** |
| Annual deaths | **2.19 million** |
| Case fatality rate | **17.7%** |
| Share of global burden | **~1/3** |

**Stroke is not just an "elderly disease"**. While age is the primary risk factor, the proportion of "middle-aged strokes" (ages 45-64) is rising rapidly, associated with younger onset of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.

## 2. Classification of Stroke

Stroke is classified into two major categories:

### 2.1 Ischemic Stroke

- **Proportion**: Approximately **85%**
- **Mechanism**: A blood clot blocks a cerebral vessel, causing brain tissue ischemia and necrosis
- **Treatment goal**: Restore blood flow before brain cells die

This is LT3001's target indication.

### 2.2 Hemorrhagic Stroke

- **Proportion**: Approximately **15%**
- **Mechanism**: A cerebral vessel ruptures, causing blood to leak into brain tissue
- **Treatment goal**: Stop bleeding, reduce intracranial pressure

Hemorrhagic stroke **cannot** be treated with thrombolytic drugs, as this would worsen the bleeding. This is why imaging must be performed before stroke treatment to confirm whether the vessel is "blocked" or "ruptured."

## 3. Four Types of Ischemic Stroke

Ischemic stroke is classified by etiology (TOAST classification) into four major types:

| Type | Proportion | Mechanism | Clot Characteristics | Thrombolysis Efficacy |
|------|------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Cardioembolic** | 20-25% | Clot travels from the heart | Fresh, red, fibrin-rich | **Best** |
| **Large Artery Atherosclerosis** | 25-30% | Arterial plaque rupture | Mixed, predominantly white thrombus | Poor |
| **Lacunar** | 25-30% | Deep small vessel disease | May not be a clot | **Almost ineffective** |
| **Unknown** | 15-25% | No identifiable cause | Mixed | Uncertain |

**Why is thrombolysis almost ineffective for lacunar stroke?**

Because lacunar stroke is typically caused by small vessel pathology (such as lipohyalinosis, fibrinoid necrosis) rather than clot occlusion. If there's no clot, thrombolytic drugs have no target.

This distinction is critical for understanding LT3001's Phase 2 data (see Chapter 5).

## 4. The Race Against Time: Brain Cell Death

Stroke is a race against time.

When a clot blocks a cerebral vessel, the ischemic brain tissue divides into two zones:

### 4.1 Infarct Core

- Completely ischemic zone
- Brain cells begin dying within **minutes**
- **Irreversible**, cannot be salvaged

### 4.2 Ischemic Penumbra

- Partially ischemic zone (collateral circulation provides some blood supply)
- Brain cells are in a "dying" state but not yet dead
- **Salvageable**, but time is limited

The core goal of stroke treatment is to restore blood flow before the penumbra converts to infarct core.

**Timeline**:

```
After symptom onset:
├── 0-4 minutes: Neurons begin experiencing hypoxia
├── 4-10 minutes: Irreversible damage begins
├── 1-3 hours: Core zone necrosis
├── 3-6 hours: Penumbra gradually expands
├── 6-12 hours: Most penumbra has died
└── 12-24 hours: Salvageable tissue decreasing
```

This is why there's a famous saying in the stroke field:

> **"Time is Brain"**

Every minute of treatment delay results in approximately **1.9 million neurons** dying.

## 5. Scales for Assessing Stroke Severity

Clinical practice uses two primary scales to assess stroke patients:

### 5.1 NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale)

**Purpose**: Assess "acute severity" of stroke

| Score Range | Severity | Clinical Presentation |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| 0 | No symptoms | Normal |
| 1-4 | Minor | Mild limb weakness or sensory abnormalities |
| 5-15 | Moderate | Obvious hemiparesis, speech impairment |
| 16-20 | Moderate-Severe | Severe hemiparesis, decreased consciousness |
| 21-42 | Severe | Coma, multi-system involvement |

NIHSS is primarily used for acute-phase treatment decisions.

### 5.2 mRS (Modified Rankin Scale)

**Purpose**: Assess "functional recovery" after stroke

| Score | Status | Description | Independence Level |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0 | No symptoms | Returned to pre-stroke state | Fully independent |
| 1 | No significant disability | Minor symptoms not affecting daily activities | Fully independent |
| 2 | Slight disability | Cannot perform all previous activities but can care for self | Can live independently |
| 3 | Moderate disability | Requires assistance but can walk independently | Requires some assistance |
| 4 | Moderately severe disability | Cannot walk independently, cannot meet own bodily needs | Requires substantial assistance |
| 5 | Severe disability | Bedridden, incontinent, requires constant nursing care | Completely dependent |
| 6 | Dead | — | — |

**Clinical trial primary endpoints are typically mRS 0-1 or mRS 0-2**:

- **mRS 0-1**: "Excellent outcome," can live completely independently
- **mRS 0-2**: "Good outcome," can at least care for oneself

## 6. Current Treatment Options

### 6.1 Pharmacological Therapy: tPA (Alteplase)

- **Approval date**: 1996
- **Treatment window**: Within **4.5 hours** of symptom onset
- **Mechanism**: Direct injection of thrombolytic enzyme to dissolve clots
- **Primary risk**: Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) 2-6%

See Chapter 2 for details.

### 6.2 Mechanical Thrombectomy: EVT (Endovascular Thrombectomy)

- **Approval date**: 2015 (after MR CLEAN and other trials proved efficacy)
- **Treatment window**: Originally 6 hours, extended to **24 hours** in 2018 (with imaging selection)
- **Eligible patients**: Large vessel occlusion (LVO) patients
- **Mechanism**: Physical extraction of the clot via catheter

EVT is the most important advancement in stroke treatment in recent years, but it has two limitations:

1. **Only applicable to large vessel occlusion**: Approximately 30-40% of ischemic strokes
2. **Requires specialized team and equipment**: Many hospitals cannot perform the procedure

Therefore, for patients **without large vessel occlusion** or **unable to undergo EVT**, pharmacological therapy remains the only option.

### 6.3 Supportive Care

- Blood pressure management
- Prevention of complications (pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, etc.)
- Early rehabilitation

## 7. The Unmet Medical Need

Despite having tPA and EVT, stroke treatment still has enormous gaps:

| Treatment | Applicable Proportion | Limiting Factors |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|
| tPA | **<5%** | Treatment window too short, bleeding risk too high |
| EVT | **~15%** | Only for large vessel occlusion, requires specialized equipment |
| **No treatment** | **>80%** | — |

**Over 80% of stroke patients currently have no effective acute-phase treatment.**

This is LT3001's opportunity:

- Treatment window extended to **24 hours**: Covers more patients
- Bleeding risk **0%**: Physicians are more willing to prescribe
- No special equipment required: Any hospital can use it

If LT3001 succeeds, it will fill this enormous treatment gap.
